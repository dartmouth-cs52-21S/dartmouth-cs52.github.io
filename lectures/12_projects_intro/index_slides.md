* <span style="color: #F27D00">RE</span>presentational <span style="color: #F27D00">S</span>tate <span style="color: #F27D00">T</span>ransfer
  * software architecture style
  * guidelines for web app to server communications

???

name:  RESTful API


* Server should export resources to clients using unique names (URIs)
  * http://api.domain.com/photo/ is a collection
  * http://api.domain.com/photo/48s9c8s83j is a resource
* Server supports a set of HTTP verb mapping to CRUD

???
* resources avaible via http
* in file like paths
* helps to organize and think in terms of **paths to resources** rather than actions or functions
* why is this bad?

* Server supports a set of HTTP verbs mapping to CRUD
  * *GET* method - Read resource (list on collection)
  * *PUT* method - Update resource
  * *POST* method - Create resource
  * *DELETE* method - Delete resource
* **do**: PUT `api.com/posts/:id`
* **don't**: POST `api.com/updatePostByID`


???
* endpoints are resources not actions
* why would it be bad to have action endpoints?
   * have hundreds potentially
   * getUser, getUserProfile, getListViewAuthorized, etc

1. define resources, give them unique names (URIs)
1. clients use CRUD operations via HTTP methods
1. keep abstractions clean: GET's don't delete, etc
