---
name: React Onwards and Upwards

.small[![](img/pure-function.png)]


* `fn(data) = View`
* UI is a function of your state
* props are to components what arguments are to functions



???
* why revolutionary?
* view as a pure function of data
* in buzzfeed quiz you very likely ran into issues with things maybe not updating, or being dependent on checking the state of other things.  imagine a site that is much more complex. 
* we'll be talking a lot about component this component that
* everything is a component in react
* each node in virtual DOM is component







---
name: JSX? 

```html
<div className="red">let's talk SA4 and React!</div>
```
```js
React.createElement("div", { className: "red" },
  "let's talk SA4 and React!"
);
```

.small[![](img/react-table.png)]


???
* we're a couple of days behind on the shorts, so lets get cranking through those, next lab is out tomorrow
* this can be react - well jsx
* who's confused about JSX?
* javascript XML
* syntax for defining views in render



---
name: JSX

```js
const aDivElement = <div className="foo" />hi</div>;
//or
React.createElement("div", { className: "foo" }, "hi");

const aComponent = <MyComponent someProperty={true} />;
//or
React.createElement(MyComponent, { someProperty: true });

```

* JSX is html-like syntax for defining react tree nodes
* instantiate your components for fun and profit!


???
* react components rendering is defined in JSX
* what enables us to use this nice syntax?  babel


---
name:

.medium[![](img/jquery-style-vs-react-style.png)]

???
* now that you are all jquery masters
* with jquery you can change stuff on the page but your code logic doesn't necessarily know anything about it
* lab2 vs lab3
* react simplifies things
* we'll build like 5 react apps in the coming weeks so don't worry if its all a bit confusing
* rather than looking up and poking, is more clearly state driven
* on click of one choice in quizz did you have look up and de-select all the other ones?  - imagine on click all you have to do is change data - and then the view automatically matches it.
* change state -> render, repeat
* *not a render loop btw* - only on state change






---
name: Data Binding


 * connection between application UI and business logic
 * when data changes value the elements that are bound to the data reflect changes
 * most UI frameworks have some form of data binding

```html
<input type="text" value={username}>
```
↕️ ↕️ ↕️
```js
var username = '';
```

???
* concept evolved in more complex frameworks than jquery (angular say)
* you have some data - and you have some display - how to make it easier to work together
* idea was what if a UI display could be directly tied to the persistent value in your code
* if one changes so does the other
* **what might be the problem here?**
  * what if when the username changed you wanted to do something like check it on the server?

---
name: Bindings

.medium_small[![](img/databindings.png)]


???
* here's another view of this
* critical difference is that with two-way - there is no explicit event, it just updates the value, you don't know how the watchers work
* boom value is different, did you happen to notice? no? ok bye.
* theoretically you could code the 'watchers' to trigger events, but most frameworks don't do that 
* **biggest issues is** that since each variable that is bound is independent, then have to manually remember to update dependent stuff if necessary

---
name: Some React Postulates

1. Managing state is treacherous
1. Two-way bindings are evil
1. Data mutations can be tricky

???
* state:
  * what button was clicked
  * what is being displayed etc
* transparency: effects of a value change should be limited/local
  * or at least **easy to reason about**
  * Also a useful concept regarding state change
  * Two-way bindings open Pandora’s box:
    * No easy way of knowing how far-reaching a change in the reverse direction is going to be
* **mutable state and sideeffects are not transparent**
* hard to test
* what if you needed to compute somethings or validate something on that data






---
name:

![](img/1setstate.png)


???
* react's solution - all state changes are events
* you run setState and it only affects shit downriver

* hint: think reusable: generic input bar vs youtube searchbar





---
name:

.medium[![](img/videos-components.png)]

* searchbar is smart because its driven, doesn't have to be but better when it is

  render() {
    return <ul> {renderList()} </ul>;
  }

???
* note the class property arrow function - automatically bound
* simplified example, why is parentComponent a bad example?
* doesnt' do anything useful with click event
* should run setState
* lot of good stuff going on here


---
name: component lifecycle

.large[![](img/simple-lifecycles.jpg)]


???

* http://projects.wojtekmaj.pl/react-lifecycle-methods-diagram/
* componentDidMount()  can call setState here if you need again - render may be called twice
* componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState)- can call setstate, but wrap in conditional to not cause loop
* componentWillUnmount() - use this to clean up any listeners or timers




---
name: React Drawbacks

* NONE
  * long props chains
  * component separation
  * input fields a little annoying

???
* but we'll fix most of this next week with Redux
* the answer to state management everywhere
* more and more framework are adopting the state first reactive approach




---
name: State Details

```javascript
//initialize State
this.state = {video: null}
```

```javascript
//set new state once video fetched
this.setState({video: new_video});
```

```javascript
render() {
  if (!this.state.video) { return <div>loading</div>; }

  return (
    <div>this.state.video.name</div>
  );
}
```




???
* react state is internal to component
* should be modified only through setState
* where modified is really set to new state
* we'll see later why this is important
* but generally if you modify directly react won't know about it and won't update
* also note the flow here - first time component is rendered... video key is null!


---
name: Functional setState "one step behind"

```javascript
//initialize State
this.state = {count: 0}
```

```javascript
this.setState({count: this.state.count+1});
console.log(this.state.count) // 0
this.setState({count: this.state.count+1});
// batch update merging objects
// then end result is 1

```

```javascript
this.setState(prevState => ({count: prevState.count+1}));
console.log(this.state.count) //0
this.setState(prevState => ({count: prevState.count+1}));
// batch update queues function calls in order
// end result is 2
```



???
* setstate as asynchronous - we'll do lots more with asynch of thurs
* you may run into issues like this, you try to use the state right after setting it to a new thing - but it'll be one step behind


---
name: expanded component lifecycle


.medium[![](img/react-lifecycle.png)]

* forceUpdate bad
* shouldComponentUpdate rarely used
* snapshot can read the dom for instance to get scroll position if you need it
* getDerivedState includes prevState and nextProps in case, you won't need this generally unless you are doing something bad
* could use it change state in a particular way based on nextProps
* don't shadow state <- props
