## Overview

We've seen a fair amount of class components *and* functional components in React, but up until now, the distinguishing factor has been that class components have state, while functional components don't. 

Here, we'll see that hooks allow us to use functional components with state, redux, and other aspects of React that we've mostly seen in the context of class-based components thus far...all in terms of functions! 

## Let's Start

üöÄ Clone your **SA2 (React Intro)**.  Create a new branch with `git checkout -b react-hooks`. We'll refactor all class-based code into hooks. Using a branch seems appropriate.

## Search Bar

üöÄ Let's start with `search_bar.js`. As a recap, this component consists of an `<input>` component for which every time the input value changes, we store it in state under the variable name `searchterm`.

‚ùì Why did we make this component class-based in the first place? Because it requires state! However, with hooks, we don't need class-based components to have state; we can just use the relevant hook!

üí° The first thing we need to do is transform this class component into a functional one. Create a function with the same name, `SearchBar`, which takes in `props` as a parameter. You'll recall that functional components **return** any values they're supposed to render, which is equivalent to the JSX returned by the `render()` function of a class component. Let's fill in that part of the component:

```javascript
const SearchBar = (props) => {
  return (
    <div id="search-bar">
      <input onChange={onInputChange} value={searchterm} placeholder="search" />
    </div>
  );
};
```

üóíÔ∏è We still need to translate two parts of `SearchBar`: state and our `onInputChange` function. 

<br>

:bulb: We can incorporate state using React's `useState` function. Start by importing `useState` from React (hint: it's not the default export!).

Then, add the following line right after the function declaration:
```javascript
  const [searchterm, setSearchTerm] = useState('');
```
:bulb: This declares a variable called `searchterm` in state, as well as a setter, `setSearchTerm`, to update it. That is, to update `searchterm` to `'newSearchTerm'` in state, call `setSearchTerm('newSearchTerm')`. The initial argument, `''`, sets the initial value to an empty string.

:mag: Now, let's add the last piece of the puzzle. Declare `onInputChange` like an ordinary function, but keep it within the body of `SearchBar`.

<summary>Stuck? Take a look below!</summary>

Add the following snippet immediately before the `return` statement:

```javascript
const onInputChange = (event) => {
    setSearchTerm(event.target.value);
    props.onSearchChange(event.target.value);
  };
```
</details>

üéä Nice work! The search bar is good to go! You can test this in the same way that you did for the React and Redux short assignments.

## Video Detail
üí¨ While `VideoDetail` doesn't have component state, it uses Redux state! You should already have a functional component here, but if you don't, switch your component over.

üìπ As a recap, `VideoDetail` should currently track `list` inside of the part of Redux state declared by the reducer we've called `video`, which is declared inside of `mapStateToProps`, which we connect to `VideoDetail` using the function `connect`. If that isn't currently the case, see the Redux short assignment.

:bulb: How can we update this component to use hooks? We can switch out the `connect` function and `mapStateToProps` for `useSelector`! `useSelector` allows us to access different parts of Redux state similarly to `mapStateToProps`.

Instead of the `connect` function, import `useSelector` from `react-redux`. Then, at the top of the `VideoDetail` components, add the following line:

```javascript
const video = useSelector((state) => state.video.selected);
```

:bulb: The above code snippet does the same thing that `mapStateToProps` and `connect` do: it connects `VideoDetail` to the Redux store and pulls out the `video` variable, which is stored in the same place as before! You can now delete `mapStateToProps` and remove `connect` from the export statement, so it looks like the following line:

```javascript
export default VideoDetail;
```

üéä You can now test that this component works as expected. A similar fix can be applied to counters. Woohoo! Two components down, two to go!

## Video List Item
üí° Similar to `VideoDetail`, `VideoListItem` interacts with Redux‚Äîbut in this case, it uses `mapDispatchToProps`. Just like the `useSelector` equivalent of `mapStateToProps`, `useDispatch` is similar to `mapDispatchToProps`.

Switch out the `connect` import from `react-redux` for `useDispatch`. Then, in the first line of the `VideoListItem` functional component, define `dispatch` as an instance of `useDispatch()`:

```javascript
const dispatch = useDispatch();
```

üí° Now, wherever you called `props.selectVideo`, instead, call `dispatch(selectVideo(props.video))`. For example, the `onClick` of your list item element could look as follows:
```javascript
onClick={() => dispatch(selectVideo(props.video))}
```

‚ùì What does this mean? Calling `dispatch(selectVideo(props.video))` connects `selectVideo` to Redux for this component and calls the function with an argument of `props.video`.

üóíÔ∏è Test this component; it should work! One more component to go!

## YouTube
üìπ The `YouTube` component has the most moving parts on our site. We're going to use not one, not two, but **three** hooks to replicate its functionality with hooks.

üìñ First, let's translate our class-based component to a functional one. Something that will be quite clear from this swap is that **functional components don't use the keyword `this`.** Since our new component won't have a constructor, we'll need to add in that information somewhere, but let's table our old constructor's contents for now and translate `search` and `render`, just like we did earlier. We'll come back for an initial search and debouncing that function.

üé£ Now, onto using hooks! Let's start with something we've seen before: `useDispatch`! Swap out the `connect` import statement, add a line to reference `useDispatch` at the top of the functional component, and wrap `setVideos` in a call of `dispatch`. Take another look at the `VideoListItem` code if you get stuck; it's the same idea!

üóíÔ∏è There are two parts of our original functionality that we're still lacking: an initial search and debouncing. We'll handle these with two new hooks now.

üîç We want an initial search to run on the component the first time it's rendered. Where should we put this call? In the function body itself? That's not a great idea, because the function is run on every render, and we only want this initial search to appear the first time.

üí° This is a perfect use case for the `useEffect` hook! Import it from `react`, in the same way that we did `useState` earlier, and stick the following code into the body of the functional component, after `search` and before `return`:

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
    search('pixar');
  }, []);
```

üí° The `useEffect` hook tells React that there's something your component needs to do after it's rendered. Its inputs are a function and a dependency array. Every time a value in the dependency array is updated, it triggers a function call. Here, since we have no dependencies (and hence an empty dependency array), this function is called once when the component is mounted, similar to `componentDidMount` from our class-based alternatives.

:bulb: There's one last thing we need to do: debounce our search function! Import `useCallback`, also from `react`, and put the following line after the search function and before our `return`:

```javascript
const debouncedSearch = useCallback(debounce(search, 500), []);
```
üí° The `useCallback` hook is structured similarly to `useEffect`. It returns a memoized version of the callback that is passed‚Äîin, in this case `debounce(search,500)`. The debounce function returns a debounced version of the search function that batches up calls every half-second (500 milliseconds). This hook, similar to `useEffect`, is useful for preventing unnecessary renders, but specifically for callback functions.  Since a hooks based component is just an function, every const and function definition is recreated every render call - to prevent that, `useCallback` takes a function and returns a version of it that persists across renders.  

To integrate `debounceSearch` instead of `search`, swap out `search` for `debouncedSearch` in the `onSearchChange` attribute of `SearchBar` in the `return` statement. This call of the component should now look like so:
```javascript
<SearchBar onSearchChange={debouncedSearch} />

```

üé• Your YouTube component‚Äîand the shor tassignment as a whole‚Äîshould now be fully up and running! Nice work!
