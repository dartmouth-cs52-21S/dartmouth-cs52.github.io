Have you ever wanted something explained to you in terms that you understood, in a way that explained the purpose of something, why it exists, and the high level overview of the what and how? 

AND have you ever tried to decide between several technologies and not known what to use or where to start?

This spring, rather than creating workshops, we're going to do something a bit more fun. In part to get our teamwork muscles working again in prep for final projects. In small teams, we'll create short presentations about some cool web technologies that aren't covered in the official stack.

In each video you are free to create it in any way you want.  You could edit together a video from separately recorded individual parts, you could record a zoom presentation, you could use any number of video editing or animation tools, canva, animoto, etc. 

You have 5-10 minutes to motivate the technology, demo its use cases, and discuss challenges and opportunities. Short but sweet. You should show your own experiments with this technology. 

## Pods!



## Topic

You are free to choose a topic related to the general category that was formed for your team.  There are suggestions on the survey, but if you want to present something else, feel free to reach out for other suggestions / or propose your own.


## Basics

* [ELI5](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/)
* motivate the technology
* where in the stack â€” show where the technology fits into the web dev process (dev tool, frontend framework, preprocessor, language etc)
* show some use cases
* discuss challenges and opportunities
* demo tutorials you followed and what you built
* show some code examples to illustrate any concepts
* summarize
* end with a resources section that includes links to any tutorials you followed.

Motivating the technology is import.  This should start with an [ELI5](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/) and then you can expand to how it fits in with what we've learned so far and use cases. What is the big deal about this thing you are presenting, why should I care? 


## Tutorials and Resources

You should research your topic and find some online resources that you would then be recommending to the class.  As a team you should attempt to follow the tutorials to build something that you would then talk about in the video.  For instance, say you tried out some tutorial to add facebook authentication and social features to a react app.  Show some of this in your video briefly (code / output) and discuss your own in-practice experience.  Could be positive/negative/mixed etc. The idea is that you do enough to form an educated opinion that you are sharing with the class, along with why we might be interested in trying it out.

## Be Creative

This should be fun for you to do. It is a combination of a short hackathon, teamwork, and some creativity in creating the video. 

## To Turn In

* submit link to video file to your video submitted via google drive drop folder on canvas
