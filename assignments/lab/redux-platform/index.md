## Redux CRUD Platform: Client

![](img/redux.png)

We'll build a React+Redux Content Platform.  It can be a platform for any type of content you desire. As long as there are individual content items that have some content that need to be saved to a database! Aside from the core functionality of creating an item with title and content, showing those, editing the fields, and deleting, you should feel free to be creative with it.  It will basically be a CRUD platform ‚Äî create, read, update, delete, storing data on a server with best practices, user authentication, and security ‚Äî those features encompass a world of possibilities.

### Lab 4

We'll build out a Create+Update+Delete (CRUD) style content app using React and Redux and React-Router.  We will use an API server hosted at: `https://platform.cs52.me/api`.   

For now the API only supports 'title', 'content', 'tags', 'coverUrl', but even with just those fields (especially if content supports markdown) you could think  of other things that you could display. Menu Items for a restaurant. Or even quiz answers (you'll be able to add fields in Lab 5).

Be creative and make this your own.

üç∞ Feel free to use any CSS or React Component Libraries that you want.

### Lab 5

We will rip out `platform.cs52.me/api` and build our own Nodejs+Express+Mongo based API server.  Finally FULL-STACK!  You'll be able to modify the data model at this point and really make your platform do anything. We'll also add authentication and image uploading!


## Let's Start

üöÄ To start grab the github classroom link from canvas to clone the repository.  Then you'll pull in your webpack+babel+eslint+react+routing+redux starter code like so:

```bash
#make sure you are in your project directory
git remote add starter git@github.com:dartmouth-cs52-20s/starterpack-your-gitub-username.git
git pull starter main  # you may need --allow-unrelated-histories
```

```bash
# also don't forget to run:
npm install #to fetch all your webpack dependencies
```


## CRUD API

We'll be using an API server running at https://platform.cs52.me/api

The API has the following endpoints:

* GET  `/api/posts/`
  returns **only** title, tags, and id for all posts, **not** content
  `[[{"id":"",title":"","tags":"", "coverUrl":""},...]`
* POST `/api/posts/` with post parameters `{'title', 'tags', 'content', 'coverUrl'}`
  creates a new post
* PUT `/api/posts/:postID` with parameters `{'title', 'tags', 'content', 'coverUrl'}`
  will update an entry
* GET `/api/posts/:postID`
  returns the full post data found at `postID`, including `content`
* DELETE `/api/posts/:postID`
  deletes the post found at `postID`

### API key
For each of these you need to append an api key.  This key can just be your `firstinitial_lastname`.   You can test the api using [insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) or curl.

### Testing APIs from CLI with curl
There is a command that you can run in Terminal called `curl` that can fetch remote data.  Here's how you would use it for testing the api server.  This will also come in handy when you have to create the api server next week! 

```bash
# all posts get:
curl -X GET "https://platform.cs52.me/api/posts?key=YOURKEY"

# create new post
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
    "title": "first post",
    "tags": "words",
    "content":  "this is a test post",
    "coverUrl": "https://media.giphy.com/media/gyRWkLSQVqlPi/giphy.gif"
}' "https://platform.cs52.me/api/posts/?key=YOURKEY"

# update by POSTID
curl -X PUT -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
    "title": "new title"
}' "https://platform.cs52.me/api/posts/POSTID?key=YOURKEY"

# fetch 1 by POSTID
curl -X GET "https://platform.cs52.me/api/posts/POSTID?key=YOURKEY"

# delete by POSTID
curl -X DELETE -H "Content-Type: application/json" "https://platform.cs52.me/api/posts/POSTID?key=YOURKEY"

```

Try these out.  Run the create new post one a couple of times to populate your database!

This will work a bit different from the react-notes, and in a way will be much simpler.  Every time you want to update, create, delete, retrieve, you will use http calls like the above to interact with the server. 

Remember our SPA architecture:

![](img/single-page-app.png){: .medium}

The above are the data requests we'll be making. They all return *JSON*. 

This site will *not* update live in the sense that if someone else on another browser added a post, you would not see it pop up automatically, but would need to reload.  This is fairly common of most platforms like this, your feed does't change as you look at it, you need to refresh to see new articles.  Once Redux is in place it'll be really easy to trigger a refresh with a button or pull down though if you want. 

## Routes

We're going to use some routes to set up our app with different "pages".  

üöÄ Your routes could look something like this.  Basically you're going to have a route for creating new posts (this will be a form) and a page for showing a post by ID. The default route will show a list of all posts.


```html
<Switch>
  <Route exact path="/" component={Posts} />
  <Route path="/posts/new" component={NewPost} />
  <Route path="/posts/:postID" component={Post} />
  <Route render={() => (<div>post not found </div>)} />
</Switch>
```

This is just the basics, feel free to expand on this. For reference it might help to look back on the [routes short assignment](../sa/routing).  Refresh your understanding of what the `:postID` part of the route means. 


### App

Is a simple component that simply renders a *NavBar* component and the route components. You can think of this as your main layout!

### NavBar

A simple component that renders a nav with two `<NavLink>` `react-router-dom` components such as the following:

* `<NavLink exact to="/">My Super Awesome Blog</NavLink>`
* `<NavLink to="/posts/new">new post</NavLink>`



### Posts

This will be the default page.  It will display a list of posts.  These posts can look like whatever you want.  The posts will be stored in the redux state rather than any single component so this will need to be a connected component that connects to `state.posts.all`. In your listing you should utilize each posts *coverUrl*, *title*, and *tags*.

Try the curl commands above, you'll see that one of the fields you get back in the JSON is `id`.  You'll use that construct `NavLink` elements to `posts/:postID` when you render the posts. Each post should be clickable to open it full page using this route. `<Link to={`posts/${post.id}`}>...`.  Where `:postID` is provided the router, refer back to the routing short to see how we did that there.

Min specs at a glance:

* default page listing all posts
* use post id to link to full view
* show *coverUrl*, *title*, *tags* in some form - can be a list, can be tiles, whatever you want!

Hint: As this is a connected component that relies on the list of posts, you'll want to run your `props.fetchPosts()` *ActionCreator* from `componentDidMount` or with the equivalent empty dependency list `useEffect` hook.

### NewPost

This is a component to create a new blog post. Should be a connected component that can trigger actions via *ActionCreators*. You *could* have one component that is used for create, show, and update. Personal preference on this, but it might be easier at first to have a simple new post component and then refactor later to have one component that does double duty.

### Post (display and edit)

This is the component that gets loaded when you want to see the full rendered contents of a single post.  *Post* should display the full content of the post (selected by the ID that is passed in through `this.props.match.params.postID`.  This post id parameter will come from the react-router when you navigate to:  `/posts/:postID`.  Where does postID come from in general?  It is automatically assigned to your post by the API when you create the post (similarly to how firebase assigned automatic keys).

Your *Post* component should provide a way to edit the post.  You can either have an edit button that makes the whole post editable, or you could have in place editing for each field as in the gif.  Another option is to have an edit route:  `/posts/:postID/edit` for instance.  Personal preference here, lots of different design choices you can make. 

*Note: for now the shared API server only supports title, tags, content, coverUrl as fields.  In part 2 you will implement your own server and can add or change fields then.*

Min specs at a glance:

* render full content of post at route `/posts/:postID`
* render markdown
* allow editing of post fields
  * either in separate form or as individual editable fields

This is a connected component that can both trigger actions and is connected to the global redux state.

<details markdown="block">
<summary>‚ùìWhat is this connected thing you keep talking about?!
</summary>

It is a react-redux `connect` function that makes your component connected to the redux store.  It takes 2 arguments:

1. `mapStateToProps`: like what is says, take in redux state, outputs a dictionary mapping only the keys we are interested in.
2. `mapDispatchToProps`: takes in dispatch returns mapping of ActionCreators we want to be able to use in this component. Can just take all actions if we want, or provide just the ones we are interested in. 
3. ^ all of the above end up in `props`, remember that. 

And here's some giveaway code for your `Post` component: 

```javascript
// some imports
import { connect } from 'react-redux';
import { fetchPost, deletePost, updatePost } from '../actions/index';


function mapStateToProps(reduxState) {
  return { 
    currentPost: reduxState.posts.current
  };
}

// enables this.props.currentPost
// and this.props.fetchPost, this.props.deletePost, and this.props.updatePost
export default connect(mapStateToProps, { fetchPost, deletePost, updatePost })(Post);
```

*What other components will need to be connected like this?*

</details>

## Redux

We will be using [redux](http://redux.js.org/) for our application state.  We're going to just have 1 reducer to start with: `postsReducer`.   This reducer will be associated with the key `posts` in our `combineReducers` and will return the global state as an object that looks something like this initially:

```javascript
posts: {
  all: [],
  current: {},
}
```

The state within the `postsReducer` looks like this:

```javascript
{
  all: [],
  current: {},
}
```

## Actions

Here are some actions you should consider implementing.  Note, only FETCH_POST and FETCH_POSTS need to be handled by the reducer currently. This is because we are just updating and reloading all notes after a delete say, rather than manually editing the list. If you had millions of posts you might want to not have to do a full fetch of all posts on a delete, but in our case it doesn't matter.  However, you should still package up all the asynchronous calls in ActionCreators to keep everything in the same place. **Do not do any api calls from anywhere else in the app, only in ActionCreators.** This is a bit different from the short assignment redux refactor, but is the way we'll do from now on!

```javascript
export const ActionTypes = {
  FETCH_POSTS: 'FETCH_POSTS',
  FETCH_POST:  'FETCH_POST',
  // UPDATE_POST: 'UPDATE_POST',
  // CREATE_POST: 'CREATE_POST',
  // DELETE_POST: 'DELETE_POST',
};
```

Wait, what about UPDATE_POST, surely that has to exist... technically yes, you do want to update, buuut in practice it does the same things as FETCH_POST...

Now you might ask, how the heck do we fetch from an API using actions!?

Don't worry, this part we'll walk you through.

###  Connecting to API

First thing we'll need is to install the `redux-thunk` library. Not another library!  Actually, we'll need two libraries for this functionality. `axios` will give us an nice promise based ajax library.


```javascript

npm install redux-thunk
npm install axios

```

#### [Axios](https://github.com/mzabriskie/axios)

Axios gives us a promise based interface to make API requests.   Here is an example of a get:

```javascript
const ROOT_URL = 'https://platform.cs52.me/api';
const API_KEY = '?key=yourfirstname_yourlastname';

axios.get(`${ROOT_URL}/posts${API_KEY}`).then(response => {
  // do something with response.data  (some json)
}).catch(error => {
  // hit an error do something else!
});
```

*Note: this is an promisified asych function! results are only available in the `.then`. You can also use axios with async/await if you prefer.*

Axios supports *GET*, *POST*, *PUT*, *DELETE*, and other *HTTP* verbs.

With *POST* and *PUT* you need to supply an object with key,value data.  Something like the following would work:

```javascript
const fields = {title: '', content:'', coverUrl: '', tags: ''}
axios.post(`${ROOT_URL}/posts${API_KEY}`, fields)
```

*Note: `fields` in the above is just an example. I called it fields here in reference to form fields, but the point is that you can send any old javascript object.*

#### [Thunks](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-thunk)

The big question on your mind is how you would put this into an action I bet.  Right?  No?

We have to set up `redux-thunk` first.

üöÄ In your root `index.js` file:

```javascript
// at the top
import thunk from 'redux-thunk';

// change the applyMiddleware line:
applyMiddleware(thunk),
```

We'll dig more into what middleware is later, but for now what you need to know is that middleware are basically functions that run between other stuff. They can be very powerful.  

Redux middleware wraps the `dispatch` function, allowing our `redux-thunk` middleware to process not just actions but also functions.  *ActionCreators* can now return thunks rather than just actions.  These thunks are functions that are created on the fly to run something later.  Whaaaat?

![](img/reduxwithmiddleware.gif){: .small}

Remember how *ActionCreators* just return an *Action*?  Well, what if you want the *ActionCreator* to first do something, perhaps fetch something from the internet?  Thunks allow this functionality.  Instead of immediately returning an *Action* object and getting dispatched to the reducers, we return a function that gets executed and can go off and do some stuff before dispatching any Actions to the reducers.

A redux thunk allows your *ActionCreators* to **return functions that can then dispatch actions**. This is done by simply returning a function that takes 1 argument, and that function will be automatically called and passed in a reference to the `dispatch` function so we can call it directly once we are done.

```javascript
export function anAction() {
  // ActionCreator returns a *function*
  // that gets called by the middleware passing in dispatch to it as an argument
  return (dispatch) => {
      // here is where you would do your asynch axios calls
      // on the completion of which you would dispatch some new action!
      // can now dispatch stuff
      dispatch({ type: 'SOME_ACTION', payload: {stuff: ''} });
  };
}
```

Dispatch is a function available in redux that handles distributing actions to reducers. In a connected component when you `mapDispatchToProps` you are wiring certain ActionCreators to automatically be called by `dispatch` like so:

![](img/dispatch.png){:  .small}

With the redux-thunk middleware we are changing how dispatch works slightly.  We enable dispatch to accept not just action objects but also functions. These functions when executed can run asynchronous methods and upon return can manually `dispatch` further actions.  These further actions can be either action objects (what we will be doing) or for more complicated logic can be further thunk functions.

![](img/dipatch+thunk.png){:  .small}

What we want to do is go and fetch some data from a rest api.  Being able to dispatch things in the middle of an action helps us do this. You'll want to do the `axios` call inside of your returned function.  You would dispatch the action if the promise was resolved and you potentially dispatch an error action in the catch.  You are combining the `redux-thunk` style ActionCreator with the `axios` api call.

You should have ActionCreator methods to deal with every axios call.

Here are the methods that you should have in your `actions/index.js` file:

```javascript
export function fetchPosts() {/* axios get */}

export function createPost(post, history) {/* axios post */}

export function updatePost(post) {/* axios put */}

export function fetchPost(id) {/* axios get */}

export function deletePost(id, history) {/* axios delete */}
```

Each of these methods will *return a function that takes dispatch as its argument*, runs some axios call, and then dispatches some action. In the above that ActionType actions are named the same as the functions, however it might help to think of them as FETCH_POSTS_SUCCEEDED for instance.  It is the action that is dispatched to the reducers with the payload results of the asynchronous call.

In the `.then` success call on create and delete you may find it useful to simply navigate to another page.  For instance when you hit delete on a blog post *Post* page you would want to be taken back to the `Posts` page.  Simply add `history.push('/')` to navigate to another page from within your ActionCreator function. But where does history come from?  Unfortunately, only routed components have access to history (not our actions module), so we will have to pass that in to our *ActionCreators* when they are called.  Add a parameter to any actionCreator that needs to call history like so `this.props.createPost(post, this.props.history)`.

‚ö†Ô∏è If you run into a problem where for some reason your *ActionCreator* seems to run but never dispatches an action, that might be because you are running the unconnected version that you imported rather than the connected version of the function that you get from `mapDispatchToProps`.  So always remember to run *ActionCreators* as their `props` version because that is what `connect()` does, it gives us a modified version of the function that is dispatched. You can think of it like this: props.yourActionCreator == dispatch(yourActionCreator). 

<details markdown="block">
<summary> ü§¶‚ÄçWant an copy/paste example‚ùì
</summary>

üÜó here you go.

```js
export function fetchPosts() {
  // ActionCreator returns a function
  // that gets called with dispatch
  // remember (arg) => { } is a function
  return (dispatch) => {
    axios.get(`${ROOT_URL}/posts${API_KEY}`)
      .then((response) => {
        // once we are done fetching we can dispatch a redux action with the response data
        dispatch({ type: ActionTypes.FETCH_POSTS, payload: response.data });
      })
      .catch((error) => {
        // whaaat? 
        // dispatch an error, use it in a separate error reducer. this is the beauty of redux.
        // have an error component somewhere show it
        dispatch({ type: ActionTypes.ERROR_SET, error});
        // might you also want an ERROR_CLEAR action?
      });
  };
}
```
</details>


## Reducers

To start with we'll only need 1 reducer in `reducers/index.js`.  Something like this:

```javascript
const rootReducer = combineReducers({
  posts: PostsReducer,
});
```

The `postReducer` that you will define will currently only need to respond to 2 ActionTypes:  FETCH_POST, and FETCH_POSTS.

We want our state to look like this:

```javascript
const initialState = {
  all: [],
  current: {},
};
```

Where `all` would contain an array of all posts, and `current` would be the current individually displaying post (for *Post*).

For FETCH_POSTS you would return the state object with the `all` property set to the new posts.  For FETCH_POST return that single post.  

Note, since we are structuring things so that the reducer returns an object, for each of the actions you'll need to return the existing state of the other fields.  You can use the `Object.assign` method we have used before, or the es6 [object spread operator](http://redux.js.org/docs/recipes/UsingObjectSpreadOperator.html). You are also welcome to implement it with multiple reducers if that is easier to reason about.


## And you are on your way!

That should be all you need to build a simple blog platform (we'll add more features later!).

If you don't know where to start, remember the steps in creating an React application (modified here to include redux considerations):

1. Start with a mock‚ùóÔ∏è
1. Break the UI into a component hierarchy‚ùóÔ∏è
1. Build the Presentational Components for a static version without any state
1. Identify what the local vs redux "global" state should be
1. Implement local UI state in Presentational components
1. Identify Redux Actions (things that change global state)
1. Create ActionCreators for each action
1. Write Reducers for each Action
1. Connect necessary components to Redux
1. Style it
1. Ship it


It might help for the *ActionCreator* -> *Dispatch* -> *Reducer* -> *State* flow, to try getting one working first.  For instance maybe get the *Post* component working first, the others will come more easily once you have the full path tested with one of them.

Don't forget to use the #lab4 slack channel.

## Style It!

Make it look pretty. Remember you are free to make this whatever you want. It does NOT have to be blog posts. Right now there are a few required fields, but how you display them is up to you. 

üç∞You are allowed and encouraged to use various CSS/Styling/Component libraries for this assignment:
* [React-bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) is an easy one. 
* [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/) has that google material look.
* [Grommet](https://v2.grommet.io/) great look and simple to use components.
* [Blueprint.JS](https://blueprintjs.com/) is popular.
* [Semantic-UI](https://react.semantic-ui.com) is pretty full featured.

## Release it!

```bash
# commit and push as you normally would - but also
git tag frontend.v1
git push origin --tags
```


## To Turn In

1. GitHub classroom repository URL
1. a new deployed working domain name URL on netlify
1. App should have individual routes for:
  * new (unless you make this a modal)
  * list view (default view)
  * full show view (needs to be a path like posts/:id)
1. App should make CRUD api calls
  * create
  * update
  * delete
  * fetch post by id
  * fetch all posts
1. should be styled reasonably
1. your repo should include a README.md file with:
  * a couple sentence description about what you did
  * and what worked / didn‚Äôt work
  * any extra credit attempted


## Extra Credit
*always mention your extra credit in the README.md file*

* make it into something other than a blog platform as long as it has the CRUD functionality
* handle `axios` errors in a graceful REDUX way, showing users a nice message. (hint: new action and error state)
* input validation ‚Äî check that all fields have required values when creating new form for instance.
* add a filter posts functionality, filter by tags initially.
  * for now our api is limited so additional search will come in lab5
* style it extra special with transitions and all that squishy animation goodness.
* more EC available in lab5!
